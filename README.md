- 🌱 I’m currently learning, how to be more relaxed and with myself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to properly secure a web application by blackbox testing/penetration testing
      (how can you without to much effort ensure security of an application), when you are not involved into internal processes, but just looking from the outside.
